# This is a Hacker Story Generator - 2025 GRC Edition
# Born out of idiots (fake hackers) claiming to be all the cybers and the war stories they sadly told.
# Now updated with modern 2025 security nightmares: AI incidents, supply chain disasters,
# OAuth mishaps, leaked API keys, and the eternal struggle of secrets in production.
# Hopefully the legit hackers (and GRC professionals) get some enjoyment from this...
# Author: ED-209-Mk7 (Updated for 2025)
# Setting: Too much caffeine, multiple incident response calls, and existential dread
# Usage: ./hacker_stories.py or $ python3 ./hacker_stories
